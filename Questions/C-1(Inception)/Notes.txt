i. Starting with Basics
    a. Created index.html page
    b. type enter emmet

ii. Integrating project with react
    a. cdn react - content delivery networks a place from where react has beenn hosted and we are pulling this in our project.
        https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html
    b. <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
        This is core react file where developers at facebook had written code to integrate our code with React.
    c. <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
        This file is used for DOM operations.
        This file is bridge between browser and react.

    Note: Why there are two files to integrate with React and can't we write both file code in one file?
    Ans:  No, we require separate files as React not only work on browsers but also for mobile devices like React Native.

iii. React Basics:

    a. How to write h1 tag in React:
        <script>
            // React.createElement(tag, object, text or anything we need to put inside tag for example inside h1 tag)
            const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World from React!")
        </script>

    b. First React Program:
        // Two files needed to integrate with React and ReactDOM
            <!-- core react file -->
            <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
            <!-- dom operations or bridge file between browser and react -->
            <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

        <!-- React Tag -->
        <script>
            // React.createElement(tag, object, text or anything we need to put inside tag for example inside h1 tag)
            const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World from React!");

            // To put above h1 inside div of id as root, we need to create root in react(comes from second script link)
            // Everything inside React will run inside root
            const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

            root.render(heading);
        </script>

        // Another way of writing it is create separate App.js file and index.css and then link both as follows:
            CSS: <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css">
            JS:  <script src="./App.js"></script>
