Q1. What is Microservice?
Ans:    Defn:   Microservices ( Microservice Architecture ) is an architectural style that structures an
                application as a collection of services that are:
                    a. Independently deployable
                    b. Loosely coupled


        In simple words,
                        1. We have different services for different job.
                            a. Backend
                            b. UI
                            c. Auth
                            d. SMS
                            e. Email Notification

                        2. All these services combine to form a big app - This is known as separation of concerns.
                        3. All these services talk to each other depending upon the use cases - Single responsibility Principle

Q2. What is a Monolith architecture ?
Ans:    Defn:   A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base
                that couples all the business together.
                To make changes to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base
                and building and deploying an updated version of the server-side interface.

        In simple words,
                        Earlier architecture made using Monolothic have single codebase.
                        Under single project,
                            API, UI, JSP, AUTH, DB, SMS written in same service.
                        Even if you need to change a color, you need to compile and build
                        this whole project.

Q3. Explained in Q1 and Q2.

Q4. Why do we need a useEffect Hook ?
Ans:    Usage:  Connecting to an External System ( API ):
                    1. Some components need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, 
                        while they are displayed on the page.
                    2. These systems are not controlled by React, so they are called external.
                To connect your component to some external system, call useEffect at the top level of your component.

        Defn:   1. Takes two arguments i.e. 

                    a. first argument --> arrow function(callback function) --> useEffect(() => {})
                    b. second argument --> dependency array --> useEffect(() => {}, [dependency])

                2. callback function will be called --> after your component renders.

                3. Conclusion:

                    useEffect(() => {
                        console.log("useEffect called!)     // called 2nd
                    }, [])


                    console.log("Body rendered")    // called 1st


Q5. What is Optional Chaining ?
Ans:    Defn:   The optional chaining (?.) operator accesses an object's property or calls a function.
                If the object accessed or function called using this operator is undefined or null,
                the expression evaluates to undefined instead of throwing an error.

        E.g.    const home = {
                    name: 'Villa',
                    fish: {
                        name: 'tinfoil'
                    }
                }

                const fishName = home.fish?.name;
                console.log(fishName);

Q6. What is Shimmer UI ?
Ans:        a. Defn - It's like loading fake page untill we get the actual data from API.
                    Created a file Shimmer.js
        
            b. Conditional Rendering - 
                if(listofRestaurants.length === 0){
                    return <Shimmer />
                }

Q7. What is difference between JS expression and JS statement ?
Ans:    Expression - A piece of code that evaluates to a single value.
                    E.g.    a. 1+1 // Arithmetic operations
                            b. Math.max(1, 2) // Function call  
                            c. let x = 1;

        Statement - A piece of code that performs an action.
                    E.g.    a. for(let i=0; i<10; i++){     // Loops
                                    // Do something
                                }
                            b. if(x > 10){                  // Conditional
                                    // Do something
                                }
                            c. let x = 1                    // Declarations

Q8. What is Conditional Rendering, explain with a code example?
Ans:    Defn:   Conditional Rendering is a technique in React that allows you to display
                different UI elements based on specific conditions.

        E.g.:   A toggle button on click of which it shows login and when clicked second
                time it shows logout button.

Q9. What is CORS ?
Ans:    Defn:   Cross-origin resource sharing(CORS) is a browser security feature
                that lets client web application interact with resources in other domains.
            
        E.g.    An application may use CORS to pull videos from a video platform API,
                use fonts from a public font library,
                or display weather data from a national weather database.

Q10. What is use of `const json = await data.json();` in getRestaurants?
Ans:    Here data is in streamable format, now to convert the data into json format,
        nned to apply data.json() which will give you final results of an API.
