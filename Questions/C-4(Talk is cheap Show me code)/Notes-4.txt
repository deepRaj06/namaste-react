ii. styles in react:

    a. <div className="res-card" style={{ backgroundColor: "#f0f0f0" }}>
        <h3>Meghana Foods</h3>
       </div>

        1. style --> in double brackets --> first bracket means --> some javascript written inside it and 
                --> second bracket means --> javascript is an object, hence require another curly braces

iii. props(properties) in react:

    a. use to pass data dynamically via a component.
    b. think of it as --> normal argument passed to a function
    c. E.g. 
            <RestaurantCard resName="KFC" cuisine="Burger, Fast Food"/>

    

iv. config-driven ui (industry standard api):

    a. website --> driven by configs --> 
        e.g. In swiggy website, offers will be different based on location, you can do this using configs.


Note: Why it is mandatory to give key inside each item in react ?

    Ans: E.g. <RestaurantCard resData={item} key={item?.info?.id}/>

                Because each component should have unique id, 
                if you do not give unique id and suppose new RestaurantCard came in
                what will React do is it will re-render all the RestaurantCards
                (meaning React will clean the while container and then put all the RestaurantCards)
                Because react doesn't know which RestaurantCard is new, to uniquely identify need to give 
                unique id or something, now new RestaurantCard came with id, now React knows RestaurantCard 
                having id = 1, id=2 , id=3 etc, so to put new RestaurantCard, it will render just one
                RestaurantCard.

         <RestaurantCard resData={item} key={index}/>

            a. React says do not use index as keys.
            b. not using keys (not acceptable) <<<<<<<<<  index as key(when unique id not available) <<<<<<<< unique id (recommonded)
