i. Cleaning code(whole code is written in App.js -- > let's just separate it)
    a. Created --> src folder --> put App.js inside it
    b. File structure --> https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html

ii. Structuring our code:

    1.components 
        a. Header.js
        b. Body.js
        c. RestaurantCard.js
    
    2. utils
        a. contants.js - As this is not a compoenent, hence starts with small letter

iii. Ways to export/import data:

    1. normal/default export/import
        export default components
        import Component from "path";
    2. named export/import (used when in single file, you have to export multiple things)
        export const Component   
        import {Component} from "path";  

Doubt: Can I use both default and named export/import in same file ?

iv. Making website dynamic:

    1. Creating a button and onclick of which it will show top rated restuarants.(Handler Event) i.e. Restaurants above 4 star
        a. 


Note: 
    Why React is fast ?
        React does the efficient and faster DOM manipulation becoz of virtual DOM(object representation)

v. Hooks: (Normal JS function)
    a. written by Facebook developers
    b. useState() - state variable in react
        1. two variables becoz, we need something i.e. setState to trigger diff Algorithm to update UI
    c   useEffect((=> {

        }))

Note: Why use state variable when we have normal variable in React ?

    1. As soon as you update the state variable, 
        it will render the UI while nomal variable doesn't renders the screen.Hence, it will not reflect there.
        state variable - will automatically refresh the screen --> this is known as render.
        Definition - Whenever state variable updates, react re-renders the component.

    2. react will keep in sync both data as well as ui layer i.e.
        as soon as data updates, ui layer will be updated.

    3. As soon as my state variables changes, 
        react will re-render the component.
        Since, react will make DOM operations faster and efficient.

vi. What is React Algorithm ?

    A. Reconciliation Algorithm - Whenever something changes on UI 
        - ( React Fiber - React 16 - New way of finding div and updating the DOM) -22:00
        a. Virtual DOM - representation of actual DOM.
        b. i.e. Virtal DOM - React Element i.e. object

    B. Diff Algorithm - find out difference between updated virtual DOM and old virtual DOM.
        a.
