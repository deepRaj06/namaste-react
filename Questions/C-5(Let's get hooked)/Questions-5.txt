Q1. What is the difference between Named Export, default export and * as export ?
Ans:    A. Named Export - Under single file, you want to import/export multiple components or values
            a. import { add, subtract } from './utils';
            
                <p>{add(2, 3)}</p>
                <p>{subtract(4, 3)}</p>

        B. * import - named import can also be exported as * symbol to import all files as an object
            a. import * as utils from '/utils';

                <p>{utils.add(2, 3)}</p>
                <p>{utils.subtract(4, 3)}</p>
